# Required Devnet Token Addresses for Live Swaps

## 🔍 What We Need

To execute live devnet swaps, I need these **Solana devnet** token mint addresses:

### Primary Tokens Needed:
1. **USDC on Devnet** - Current: `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v` (mainnet)
2. **USDT on Devnet** - Current: `Es9vMFrzaCERmJfrF4H2FYD4KCoNkY11McCe8BenwNYB` (mainnet)
3. Any other devnet tokens you want to test with

### Already Have:
✅ **SOL** - `So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112` (same on devnet)

## 📝 Common Devnet Token Addresses

If you don't have specific addresses, these are commonly used on devnet:

**Option 1: Use Jupiter's Devnet Pools**
- Jupiter can provide devnet token addresses automatically
- Or we can look up common devnet tokens

**Option 2: Get from You**
- Please provide devnet token addresses you want to test

## 🎯 What to Provide

Just tell me the **devnet** mint addresses for:
- USDC
- Any other tokens you want to swap

And I'll update the configuration to execute live devnet swaps!
