- Execution time estimation
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Updated quotes API endpoint with real DEX quotes

**Files Created:**
- `src/services/quoteEngine.ts` - Main quote generation service
- `tests/unit/quote-engine.test.ts` - Comprehensive quote engine tests

**Files Modified:**
- `src/database/redis/quoteCache.ts` - Added `cacheQuote` and `getQuote` methods
- `src/api/routes/quotes.ts` - Updated to use real quote engine

**Design Decisions:**

1. **Caching Strategy**: 30-second TTL for quotes to reduce DEX API calls while keeping prices fresh

2. **Validation Layers**: Input validation → Cache check → DEX aggregation → Result caching

3. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to cached/mock data when primary sources fail

4. **Quote Enrichment**: Adds route display and execution time estimates for better UX

5. **Execution Validation**: Checks expiration, price impact (<10%), and route availability before execution

6. **Error Handling**: All failures are logged but don't crash the service

**Known Issues/Limitations:**

1. **Validator**: Expects token amounts in decimals, not lamports - needs adjustment for SOL amounts
2. **Jupiter API**: Network connectivity issues gracefully handled with Orca/Raydium fallback
3. **Cache**: Redis connection required - quotes fail gracefully if Redis is down
4. **Smart Router**: Enhancement layer not yet fully integrated - returns raw aggregator results

**Testing:**
- Unit tests (11 tests) - All passing ✓
- Tests cover quote generation, caching, validation, and error handling

**Design Decisions:**

1. **Graph-Based Architecture**: Uses adjacency list representation for efficient traversal

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Modified shortest-path algorithm optimized for DEX routing with fee and slippage considerations

3. **BFS Path Discovery**: Breadth-first search finds all possible paths between tokens

4. **Direct vs Multi-Hop**: Prefers direct pools when available, falls back to multi-hop routing

5. **Efficiency Scoring**: Calculates route efficiency based on output amount, fees, and price impact

6. **Configurable Routing**: Supports max hops, slippage tolerance, and preferred DEX selection

**Known Issues/Limitations:**

1. **Simplified AMM Formula**: Uses constant product formula approximation - needs real pool state
2. **Mock Liquidity**: Graph is built from configuration - needs actual on-chain pool data
3. **Price Impact**: Currently estimated - needs real-time DEX data for accuracy
4. **Amount Calculation**: Multi-hop amounts simplified - needs proper amount tracking

**Testing:**
- Unit tests (11 tests) - All passing ✓

- `tests/unit/dex-clients.test.ts` - Unit tests for DEX clients
- `tests/unit/dex-aggregator.test.ts` - Unit tests for aggregator

**Design Decisions:**

1. **Unified Interface**: All DEX clients implement the same `DexClient` interface for consistency

2. **Parallel Quote Fetching**: Aggregator fetches quotes from all DEXes simultaneously using `Promise.allSettled` for resilience

3. **Smart Quote Selection**: Best quote is selected based on highest output amount, with price impact as tiebreaker

4. **Graceful Degradation**: Jupiter API failures are handled gracefully, falling back to mock Orca/Raydium quotes

5. **Mock Implementations**: Orca and Raydium clients currently use mock data (99% and 98% output respectively) until full SDK integration

6. **Configurable Priority**: DEX clients have configurable priority levels for quote ordering

**Known Issues/Limitations:**

1. **Jupiter API**: Network connectivity issues in test environment - gracefully handled with fallback
2. **Orca SDK**: Currently returns mock data - needs full Whirlpool SDK integration
3. **Raydium SDK**: Currently returns mock data - needs full AMM SDK integration
4. **Price Impact**: Simplified calculation - needs real pool data for accurate metrics

**Testing:**
- Unit tests (19 tests) - All passing ✓
- Tests cover quote fetching, route discovery, liquidity checks
- Aggregator tests verify best quote selection and error handling

**Design Decisions:**

1. **Docker-First Approach**: Using Docker Compose for local development ensures:
   - Consistent database environments
   - Easy setup and teardown
   - Health checks for service availability
   - Persistent data volumes

2. **Connection Pooling**: PostgreSQL connection pool with:
   - Maximum 20 concurrent connections
   - Idle timeout of 30 seconds
   - Connection timeout of 2 seconds
   - Automatic error recovery

3. **Database Schema**: Created 5 core tables:
   - `trades` - Trade execution records with JSONB route storage
   - `liquidity_snapshots` - Historical liquidity data
   - `agent_logs` - Agent execution logs
   - `quote_cache` - Persistent quote caching
   - `performance_metrics` - System metrics

4. **Repository Pattern**: TradeRepository for:
   - Creating trade records
   - Updating trade status
   - Querying trades by user, status, or time range
   - Getting volume statistics
   - Automatic JSON serialization/deserialization for routes

5. **Redis Caching Strategy**: Multi-tiered caching with:
   - Quote caching (30s TTL)
   - Route caching (60s TTL)
   - Liquidity caching (10s TTL)
   - Rate limiting counters

**Known Issues/Limitations:**

1. **Docker Required for Full Testing**: Integration tests require Docker containers running. Use `docker-compose up -d` to start.

2. **Database Credentials**: Default credentials in docker-compose.yml are:
   - User: liquidityflow
   - Password: devnet_password
   - Database: liquidityflow_db
   These should be changed in production.

3. **Connection Errors in Tests**: Without Docker running, integration tests will skip gracefully.

**Docker Setup:**
```bash
# Start containers
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v
```

**Testing:**
- Unit tests (43 tests) - All passing
- Database integration tests - Require Docker containers
- Test coverage includes connection pooling, schema creation, and query operations
