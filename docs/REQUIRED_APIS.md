# Required APIs and Credentials for Swap Execution

## APIs & Credentials Needed

To implement real swap execution, we need access to:

### 1. Solana RPC Endpoint
- **Status**: ✅ Already configured
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.devnet.solana.com`
- **Purpose**: Submit transactions, check balances, confirm transactions
- **Alternative**: You can provide your own RPC endpoint for better reliability

### 2. Solana Wallet/Keypair
- **Status**: ❌ Need from you
- **Required**: Private key for the backend wallet (base58 or byte array)
- **Purpose**: Sign and execute swap transactions
- **Format**: 32-byte private key (keep this SECRET!)
- **Where to provide**: `.env` file as `SOLANA_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`

### 3. Jupiter Swap API (Optional)
- **Status**: ⚠️ Network issues in test environment
- **Endpoint**: `https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6`
- **Purpose**: Execute swaps via Jupiter aggregator
- **Note**: Jupiter also provides a swap API endpoint we could use

### 4. Jupiter Swap API Endpoint
- **URL**: `https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/swap` (for executing swaps)
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Submit actual swap transactions to Jupiter

### 5. Devnet SOL for Gas
- **Status**: Need from you
- **Amount**: ~0.01 SOL on devnet for testing
- **Purpose**: Pay transaction fees
- **How to get**: 
  ```bash
  solana airdrop 1 YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
  ```

## What We Can Proceed With Now

Even without all credentials, I can implement:

1. ✅ **Transaction builder** - Build the swap transaction
2. ✅ **Transaction signer** - Sign with wallet keypair
3. ✅ **Transaction submitter** - Submit to Solana network
4. ✅ **Status tracker** - Monitor transaction status
5. ✅ **Error handling** - Handle failed transactions
6. ✅ **Tests** - Mock transactions for testing

We just need the actual wallet private key to execute real swaps.

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:

**Option A**: Build the swap execution system now with mock transactions (you can add real wallet later)

**Option B**: Wait for you to provide the Solana wallet private key, then implement

**Option C**: Build it now AND document where you need to add the wallet key

I recommend **Option C** - I'll build the swap executor now with placeholders, and document exactly where you need to add your wallet key.
